<br/>
Our goal is to bring order to the chaos of the U.S. healthcare system by harnessing the power of the cloud to modernize healthcare. We are advancing an industry whose technology is 20 – 30 years old and we need your help to do it!<br/>
<br/>
We're headquartered in Watertown, MA on the banks of the Charles River just a few miles from Harvard Square and Downtown Boston. Our Software Developers are working on development of all of our current products and services. Read the product descriptions on our main site to learn how athenaCollector, athenaClinicals, athenaCommunicator and athenaCoordinator are changing healthcare in this country.<br/>

</li><li>Operations Backend - Some of our developers work on complex backend and operations projects that directly improve our clients’ work and their athena experience.<br/>
<br/>
</li></ul>We’re looking for developers who want to work on challenging technology problems to create products that medical professionals and patients use every day. We work with a mix of technologies but don’t hire developers based on your knowledge of a particular coding language. We believe any developer worth their salt can pick new stuff up in a matter of months. We're more interested in folks with raw talent and a burning desire to succeed. <br/>
The types of problems you might work on are wide-ranging—from core performance tuning and optimizing paper-based processes using OCR to writing AJAX widgets with complicated functionality in an easy to use interface. Specifically, we’re in a LAMP stack but the only real technical requirement for applying is being able to make a computer do what you want it to do.<br/>
