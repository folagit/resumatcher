<div><span class="summary" id="job_summary">We believe strongly that a well-designed application makes customers happy, reduces support costs, and removes the need for static documentation. We ensure that every feature is customer driven, and simple enough to explain on a single page wiki. Rather than hire into well defined categories, we are looking for engineers that want to take ownership, deliver results, and make a difference in many different parts of our product and process evolution. Here is a short list of things that we discuss daily. If they make sense to you, then you likely make sense to us:
<br/>
<ul><li>Code reviews and Test Driven Development are a way of life. We know that “the slow way is the fast way.”
</li><li>Our engineers are masters of at least 1 part of our stack, are fluent in 2, and understand all 3. Our technology looks like this:
<ul><li>JavaScript/CSS
</li><li>Java/Node.js
</li><li>AWS/MySQL
</li></ul></li><li>We make heavy use of Source Code Management [Git] tooling and expect to see multiple code checkins daily.
</li><li>A deep understanding of JavaScript and recent experience with node.js and at least one of the popular client frameworks such as backbone.js, angular.js, or ExtJS.
</li><li>Proven experience with single page web applications that make asynchronous server requests via REST. I’ll call it AJAX just to get the buzzword hit on search engines.
</li><li>Practical experience with CSS and an understanding of responsive layouts. Experience with CSS pre-processing using SASS or similar tools is a plus.
</li><li>A strong desire to understand how customers use our product, not just show off all our features.

</li><li>A deep understanding of JavaScript and recent experience with node.js and at least one of the popular client frameworks such as backbone.js, angular.js, or ExtJS.
</li><li>Proven experience with single page web applications that make asynchronous server requests via REST. I’ll call it AJAX just to get the buzzword hit on search engines.
</li><li>Practical experience with CSS and an understanding of responsive layouts. Experience with CSS pre-processing using SASS or similar tools is a plus.
</li><li>A strong desire to understand how customers use our product, not just show off all our features.
