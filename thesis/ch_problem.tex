\chapter{PROBLEM}
In this proposal I proposed a personalized job-resume matching system, which could help job seeker to find appropriate jobs more easily. In the system, job descriptions and resumes will be process by pipeline; and a finite automated tool will be used to extract the model of them. The job descriptions will be matched the user's resume, the result will be sorted by the ontology similarity. Since the most appreciate jobs will be returned in front of other jobs, the users of the system could get better result than current job finding web site.
