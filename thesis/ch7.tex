\section{Future work}

Since finding a job is a complex process, which includes some subjective and objective factors.  Our work is just a initial work to solving  this problem, there are still a lof of parts could be improved. 

First for the Information Extraction part, currently the method we used is pattern matching, we could try some machine learning approaches in future. In the resume model part, we could build more complex model, like resume model, which should consider the hiring history and project experience of of job seekers, and for job description model, the company's reputation and industry should be put into the model as well. 

The system is a content based recommender system, mostly focus on compare the similarity between the resume and job description. In future work, we could introduce a hybrid-based recommender system, which could take advantage of other recommendation algorithms, like Collaborative Filtering. 

The future system all should consider more about the user's personal preference, like their location, their career development plan and so on.
