Today online recruiting web sites like Monster, Indeed etc. became one of the main channels for people to find jobs, and these web platforms have provided their services for more than ten years, that saved a lot of time and cost for both job seekers and organizations who want to hire people. But users also suffered  from  an inappropriateness  of  traditional  information  retrieval  techniques like  the  Boolean  search  methods. Since the result number of current job searching service is big, the huge reading and selection effort will be required for job seekers. So recommender system technology had been studied to resolve these problems.  This  proposal will  present  a  personalize resume-job matching system, which could obtain the models form job descriptions and resumes, and use ontology technic to find appreciate jobs for job seekers.
